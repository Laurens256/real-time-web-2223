## Week 1

In week 1, we started by creating a basic chat-app using the [socket.io library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/socket.io). Using this library, we were able to create a chatroom where multiple users could join and chat with each other.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:Laurens256/real-time-web-2223.git
```

2. Navigate to the folder

```bash
$ cd FOLDER-NAME/real-time-web-2223
```

3. Install the (dev)dependencies

```bash
$ npm install
```

4. Start the website in development mode

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

5. Open the website in your browser

```
http://localhost:3000/
```
